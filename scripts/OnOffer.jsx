        I possess what can only be described as an insatiable curiosity. There are few things I love more in the 
        world than finding a Wikipedia hole to fall into, and candidly, I‚Äôve lost more time learning about citrus fruit 
        taxonomy than I care to admit. I don‚Äôt even like oranges, but I love to find a new topic and juice the hell out 
        of it. <br/><br/>

        I carry my curiosity with me through all aspects of life, but nowhere more than coding. I started playing with 
        HTML and CSS in elementary school ‚Äî mostly little things, like online game profiles sold for in-game currency ‚Äî 
        and I‚Äôve been coming back to it ever since. I love that there‚Äôs always something new to pull apart, dig a little 
        deeper on, and experiment with. The challenge of it all, and making sense of ‚Äòthe new‚Äô, is what energizes me most.
